# Operator Safety Gear

```
A solution for the problem for ensuring safety of the industry workers
```

## Introduction

```
At many sites checking if the worker has worn all the safety gears is a manual process which consumes 
a lot of time and also a possibility of human error or 
manipulation which may be a risk.
In order to automate this process,
we trained a CNN model on our dataset to recognise 
if a particular
person is wearing helmet,gloves and shoes.
The worker is granted access/allowed to work only if the system finds
all the operator safety gear worn.
```

## Dataset

```
We created our own dataset.
We Captured videos of a person wearing and not wearing the safety gears and 
thus obtained the positive and negative frames.
We trained the CNN Model on this dataset.
```

## Challenges

```
The results were not so promising and we required 
controlled conditions for testing 
The accuracy was low.

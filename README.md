Operator Safety Gear
======================
This is a a solution for the problem for ensuring
that the workers of the industry are in proper 
safety gear.
At many sites this is a manual process which consumes 
a lot of time and also a possibility of human error or 
manipulation which may be a risk.
In order to automate this process we came up with this idea.
We trained Neural Network on our dataset to recognise 
if a particular
person is wearing helmet,gloves and shoes.
The worker is granted access only if the system finds
all the operator safety gear worn.
Here we created our own dataset since we had no 
dataset.We Captured the videos and obtained the video frames.
We trained the Neural Network on this dataset.
The results were not so promising and we required 
controlled conditions for testing as we did 
not have varied dataset.
The accuracy was low.
